# Recursion
Theory:
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.
To prevent infinite recursion, if...else statement (or similar approach) can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and the other doesn't.

Advantages of C++ Recursion:
It makes our code shorter and cleaner.
Recursion is required in problems concerning data structures and advanced algorithms, such as Graph and Tree Traversal.
Disadvantages of C++ Recursion:
It takes a lot of stack space compared to an iterative program.
It uses more processor time.
It can be more difficult to debug compared to an equivalent iterative program.
